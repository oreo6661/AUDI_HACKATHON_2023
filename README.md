# AUDI_HACKATHON_2023
A small project my team and I presented during the AUDI hackathon.

We presented our work about how AI, particularly LargeLanguageModels like ChatGPT, can be used to optimise processes in automotive companies like Audi.

And our team came up with 
# AudiKI â€” Audi Wiki

## Some examples of processes can include:

- Onboarding Information
- QA Information

AudiKI, is a chatbot repository that aims to streamline information sharing and document retrieval processes within the organization. It provides a centralized location for all information related to internal processes, allowing employees to save time and effort in searching for necessary documents and information.

Some examples of processes that can be included in AudiKI are onboarding information and quality assurance (QA) information. Onboarding information may include new employee orientation materials, training documents, and company policies and procedures. QA information may include quality control manuals, testing procedures, and reports.

By utilizing chatbot technology, AudiKI can offer a user-friendly interface for employees to access information quickly and efficiently. The chatbot can be programmed to respond to natural language queries and provide relevant documents and information in real-time. This can significantly reduce the time and effort required to search for and retrieve information, allowing employees to focus on their core responsibilities.

Furthermore, AudiKI can also be integrated with other systems and tools used by Audi, such as the company's intranet and document management systems. This integration can enable automatic updates and ensure that the information stored in AudiKI is always up-to-date and accurate.

Overall, AudiKI has the potential to enhance efficiency and productivity within the organization by providing a centralized repository of information and streamlining information retrieval processes.
