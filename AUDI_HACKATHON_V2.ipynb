    "    [\"Write me a text in French explaining the new hybrid car policy at Audi\", \"\"\"Audi a récemment annoncé sa nouvelle politique en matière de voitures hybrides, dans le but de favoriser une utilisation plus responsable et durable de l'énergie. Cette nouvelle politique met en avant une gamme de véhicules hybrides rechargeables, qui allient les performances et l'efficacité énergétique d'une voiture électrique, avec la flexibilité et l'autonomie d'un moteur à combustion interne.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Les nouveaux modèles hybrides d'Audi offrent une autonomie électrique allant jusqu'à 50 kilomètres, ce qui permet une utilisation quotidienne en mode électrique pour la plupart des trajets courts. De plus, la technologie hybride permet une réduction significative des émissions de gaz à effet de serre et une consommation de carburant plus efficace, ce qui contribue à réduire l'impact environnemental de la conduite automobile.\n",

    "Audi encourage également les conducteurs de voitures hybrides à charger leur véhicule régulièrement et à utiliser des sources d'énergie renouvelable pour réduire encore plus leur empreinte carbone. Pour encourager l'adoption de cette technologie, Audi propose des tarifs spéciaux pour les véhicules hybrides rechargeables et travaille en collaboration avec les gouvernements locaux pour faciliter l'installation de bornes de recharge publiques.\n",

Avec cette nouvelle gamme de voitures hybrides, Audi montre son engagement envers l'environnement et son désir de proposer des solutions innovantes pour un avenir plus durable.\"\"\"],\n",
