Cette nouvelle politique met en avant une gamme de vÃ©hicules hybrides rechargeables, qui allient les performances et l'efficacitÃ© Ã©nergÃ©tique d'une voiture Ã©lectrique, avec la flexibilitÃ© et l'autonomie d'un moteur Ã  combustion interne.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Les nouveaux modÃ¨les hybrides d'Audi offrent une autonomie Ã©lectrique allant jusqu'Ã  50 kilomÃ¨tres, ce qui permet une utilisation quotidienne en mode Ã©lectrique pour la plupart des trajets courts. De plus, la technologie hybride permet une rÃ©duction significative des Ã©missions de gaz Ã  effet de serre et une consommation de carburant plus efficace, ce qui contribue Ã  rÃ©duire l'impact environnemental de la conduite automobile.\n",

    "Audi encourage Ã©galement les conducteurs de voitures hybrides Ã  charger leur vÃ©hicule rÃ©guliÃ¨rement et Ã  utiliser des sources d'Ã©nergie renouvelable pour rÃ©duire encore plus leur empreinte carbone. Pour encourager l'adoption de cette technologie, Audi propose des tarifs spÃ©ciaux pour les vÃ©hicules hybrides rechargeables et travaille en collaboration avec les gouvernements locaux pour faciliter l'installation de bornes de recharge publiques.\n",
